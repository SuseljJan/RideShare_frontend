<h2>What are campaigns?</h2>

<p>
  Each driver gets many transport requests on each of their transport offers.
  Which is why we want to make it available to you, as a passenger to be able to send multiple
  transport requests to different transport offers even when you'll you're only planning
  to attend one of them.

  <br>
  <br>
  When submitting a transport request you'll be prompted to select a campaign under which
  you wish to submit the transport request.
  You can submit many transport requests to different transport offers under the same campaign.
  When you get selected to one of the transport offers, the campaign under which you sent transport request will be closed,
  meaning all other transport requests you sent under the same campaign will be deactivated.
